WhatsHap
========

WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing
reads, also called *haplotype assembly*. It is especially suitable for long reads,
but works also well with short reads.

The WhatsHap algorithm has been described in this publication:

    Murray Patterson, Tobias Marschall, Nadia Pisanti, Leo van Iersel,
    Leen Stougie, Gunnar W. Klau, Alexander Sch√∂nhuth.
    `WhatsHap: Haplotype Assembly for Future-Generation Sequencing
    Reads <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-05269-4_19>`_

The version of WhatsHap you find here is the result of further development
focused on making the software easy and straightforward to use. WhatsHap is now
Open Source software under the MIT license and we welcome contributions.


.. note:: WhatsHap is work in progress! In particular, the documentation is
	incomplete, not all features that we would like to have for an initial
	release are there, and there are probably bugs.
